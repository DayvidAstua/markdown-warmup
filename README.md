# markdown-warmup
Markdown exercise Hamilton Promo 3 Becode
This is the greatest markdown example in history

1. Website: http://www.pennyjuice.com/htmlversion/whoispj.htm  , pennyjuice.com
2. Is it updated frequently?
    The Code was last updated 21 January 2012, so no.
3. With a Google search :"Worst Websites of All Time"
    found this website in an artcile : https://www.branded3.com/blog/top-10-worst-websites/
    
   * Makes head hurt,
   *colors don't match up, 
   *too much information *
   *no good structure , 
    MENU on the bottom, *
    text not properly presented
    *no headers,
    *some pages text is all caps
    * takes too long to find out what the website is about : WHAT is Pennyjuice?
    e-commerce unfindable, not properly indexed
    
    4. not present at all : there is a Facebook group with 3 people ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/286764438489717/)
    5.  Burn, destroy and start anew
      * if not possible, here are our recommendations:
       - implement same design concept for each page: visual identity
       - choose a theme and choose less colors
       - Menu needs to be more clearly presented and put on top ( for blind people, too)
       - Fonts should be more uniform and readable, for example, do NOT put all CAPS on a page, and use bold, italics and larger fonts only to emphasize
       - CHange name of the " Got Jucie?" page: to better indicate that it is an e-commerce page, for example : ORDER NOW
